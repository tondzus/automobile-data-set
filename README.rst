Automobile Data Set
*******************

Relates to `https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile` data set from
UCI machine learning repository.

Currently performs feature selection using Lasso linear model and validates
the score of the new data set using MLP.

After cloning install required packages with :code:`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` and run :code:`python3 autos.py`. Optionally, but highly encouraged, create and activate `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ before installing requirements.txt.
